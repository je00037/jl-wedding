    question: "How do we get to Howarth?",
    answer:
      "The easiest way to get to Howarth given its semi-rural location is by car and there is plenty of parking at the venue itself. Otherwise you could travel by train to Keighley station and then take a taxi (approx 15 minutes) or a bus (approx 25 minutes). Your accommodation may not have its own parking, but there are various large car parks in the town where you can leave your car overnight (and they are quite cheap).",
  },
  {
    question: "When should we book our accommodation?",
    answer:
      "We would suggest that you look at organising accommodation quite soon, with Haworth being a popular place for tourists in summer a lot of options can get booked up. Please give us a shout if you need any help!",
  },
  {
    question: "We're arriving on the Friday - what should we get up to?",
    answer:
      "We would love to see you for drinks at The Old Sun Inn from 7pm. Before that, we encourage you to wander around Haworth, especially the Main Street. If you need to eat, we can recommend the Cloth Store for great beer and tacos, and for a more 'proper' meal The Hawthorn seems nice.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "We will be arriving on Saturday, how will we check into our accommodation?",
    answer:
      "We suggest you ask if you can check in early or at least get your room key. If your accommodation doesn’t allow for early check in or late check in after the wedding, you may wish to go to your accommodation after the ceremony to drop your things off and check in (hopefully this can be done quite quickly so you don’t miss much!)",
  },
  {
    question: "Is parking available at the venue?",
    answer:
      "Yes, there is a large car park for guests at Ponden Mill. Many guests will be leaving cars overnight for collection on Sunday, and they must be collected by 11am.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about parking in Haworth itself?",
    answer:
      "There probably won't be parking included at most accommodation, but there are several public car parks in Haworth. We have regularly used the Changegate and Museum car parks, and they are reasonably-priced: the Museum car park is £10 for 48 hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should we wear?",
    answer:
      "We don’t have a strict dress code, only to dress smartly and however you feel comfortable. Hopefully it will be a lovely summer's day so you won’t need lots of layers!",
  },
  {
    question: "Are children invited?",
    answer:
      "Unfortunately we don’t have enough space for lots of children so we are only inviting the children of very close family members to our wedding.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How will we get back from the venue to our accommodation at the end of the night?",
    answer:
      "Closer to the wedding date we will be getting in contact with the local taxi company to see what can be arranged. We will update again in due course, but we expect to book a handful of cars to shuttle back and forth.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where will the ceremony be taking place?",
    answer:
      "Fingers crossed, our ceremony will be taking place outside on a grassy area. You may wish to avoid wearing stiletto style heels so they don’t get stuck in the ground. We have an indoor option if the weather is not on our side.",
